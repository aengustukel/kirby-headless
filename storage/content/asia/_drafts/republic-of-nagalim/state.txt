Aboutstate:

The Nagalim independence movement, also known as the Naga separatist movement, is a long-standing separatist movement seeking independence for the Naga people, an ethnic group that spans the northeastern Indian states of Nagaland, Manipur, and Assam, as well as parts of Myanmar.

The movement began in the 1940s, when Naga leaders formed the Naga National Council (NNC) and demanded that the region be granted independence from British colonial rule. However, when India gained independence in 1947, the Naga Hills were incorporated into the new nation, sparking a decades-long insurgency against the Indian government.

The movement has been marked by intermittent violence and human rights abuses by both the Indian military and Naga separatists. In the 1950s and 1960s, the NNC launched a guerrilla war against the Indian government, leading to a period of violence and repression that lasted until the 1990s.

In 1980, a faction of the NNC split off to form the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN), which became the dominant group in the movement. The NSCN has been involved in negotiations with the Indian government in recent years, but talks have been marked by numerous setbacks and disagreements.

The Nagalim independence movement has gained international attention in recent years, with human rights organizations and civil society groups calling for an end to the Indian government's repression of Naga activists and the right to self-determination for the Naga people.

Despite ongoing negotiations between the Indian government and Naga separatists, the movement remains active, with occasional outbreaks of violence and unrest in the region.
