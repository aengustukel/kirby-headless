Intro: ‘A compendium of Stateless Nations’ (Title TBC) is an independent project started in 2017 (but will inevitably run through 2018) to document the current ethnic peoples and nation groups with ‘de-facto’ or limited recognition seeking be internationally recognized sovereign states

----

Maintext:

Some of the states have declared independence or held referendum on Independence but have not been recognised by larger sovereign state in which they exist.

Only a selection peoples and states seeking independence have been included in this compendium and they form only a fraction of nearly 420 peoples and ethnic groups seeking recognition, greater autonomy or independence worldwide. 

Certain states have been excluded from this list for various reasons. States like Kosovo and Taiwan, both members of the UNPO, are recognised by some UN member states but do not exist in the eyes of a number of others. Israel, Palestine and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic are also not listed for the same reason. States with very limited or insufficient references to be verified where excluded but could later be added with sufficient information is found.

[As there is no universally accepted definition of “nation,” “state,” or “country,” the subject generates debates, tensions, and numerous conflicts.]

Criteriaintro: To keep the list focused and concise the groups chosen for inclusion were narrowed by following a brief criteria:
